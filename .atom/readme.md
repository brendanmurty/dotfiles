# Atom Configuration

[![Screenshot of Atom with my configuration applied](screenshot.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendanmurty/dotfiles/master/.atom/screenshot.png)

Here are the contents of my [Atom](https://atom.io/) configuration directory.

Here's how to use these settings in your own Atom installation:

1. Install the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font on your computer
2. Open Atom and navigate to Settings > Packages and install the Atom packages listed in [packages.cson](packages.cson) or [packages-minimal.cson](packages-minimal.cson)
3. Close Atom
4. Copy all files in this folder (besides `readme.md`, `packages.cson` and `screenshot.png`) to your *.atom* folder (`~/.atom` on Linux and Mac or `%USERPROFILE%\.atom` on Windows)
5. Open Atom to use the new font, packages and configuration files
