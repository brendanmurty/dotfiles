1. Install and open VS Code
2. Install the plugins mentioned in [settings.json](settings.json) under the `workbench.colorTheme` and `workbench.iconTheme` setting values
3. Close VS Code
4. Copy the files in this folder to your [VS Code Configuration Directory](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations)

You can also tweak the layout colours by modifying the `workbench.colorCustomizations` section in `settings.json`.
